🔅 We can place functions on objects. And when we place a function on an object, we don't need to name the function, because we will access the function by the property name.


var varName = {
   propertyName: 'something',
   propertyNameWithFunction: function() {
      console.log(this);
   }
}

varName.propertyNameWithFunction();





❗ We use (this) to reference the object that we're on.

❗ When we want to printout a single property we use below syntax:

console.log(this.propertyName)

🔅 A function inside an object is called METHOD

🔅 We use empty function on object because we call the function with the property.
