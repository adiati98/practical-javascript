ðŸ”… Object is used to group data and functions together

ðŸ”… Let's say one object is a computer. And the specification of the computer are the properties:

   operatingSystem windows
   screenSize 15 inches
   purchaseYear 2018

            |
            |
            |
            |
            V

{
   operatingSystem: 'windows',
   screenSize: '15 inches',
   purchaseYear: 2018
}

ðŸ”… When we want to use the objects, we can assign them to a variable.

var myComputer = {
   operatingSystem: 'windows',
   screenSize: '15 inches',
   purchaseYear: 2018
}

ðŸ”… Syntax to call one property:

varName.property

ðŸ”… Object is good for organizing our code. Because all the stuff that related to the variable is on the variable's object.

ðŸ”… When we want to refer to an object itself inside of a method we have to use 'this' keyword.
