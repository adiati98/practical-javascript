ðŸ”… For loops is to repeat certain amount of code, any number of times.

ðŸ”… i = 0 ---> keep track of i from 0            // Initialization   ===> Create a variable where we start tracking.
   Say "hey" if i < 3  ---> say "hey" 3 times.  // Condition        ===> When it's true keep going, if not, stop.
   Increase i by 1                              // Final-expression ===> This will happen after each round of loop.

         V

   0 "hey"
   1 "hey"
   2 "hey"
   3 -- This when the loop will stop because we want i < 3"

         V
   
   for (Initialization; Condition; Final-expression) {
      console.log("hey");
   } 
         |
         |
         |
         |
         V 
   
   for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      console.log("hey");
   }


ðŸ”… We can make loop's condition dynamic by giving property .length
                                                            -------
                                                               |
                                                               |
                                                               |
                                                               V
                                                      tells how many items 
                                                      there are in the array 
                                                      when we have no idea

âœ¨ When we put the dynamic property .length, however we modify the variable, the amount of array will follow.



ðŸ”… var todoList = {
	todos: [],
	displayTodos: function() {
		console.log('I need to: ', this.todos);
		for (let i = 0; i < this.todos.length; i++) {
			this.todos[i] ---> to access specific item in an array. In a loop, it will be equal to each item in the array. 
		}
	},
