ðŸ”… There are times when the code that we run doesn't behave as expected. This is called bug.

ðŸ”… To check the code line by line and find the bug, we use debugger.
   It will pause the program as it runs.

ðŸ”… To debug, we just have to type 'debugger' before the codes that we want to inspect and under the 
	 method, then we call the method in the console.

ðŸ”… Click 'Step over next function' button on top.
   When we hover over a value, we can see what they are.

ðŸ”… When we done with debugging, delete the debugger.

ðŸ”… When we have a function within function, we can click the down arrow to step into the function.
   It will bring us to the function.

   e.g.: 
   
   addTodo: function(todoText) {
			debugger;
			this.todos.push({
				todoText: todoText,
				completed: false
			});
			this.displayTodos();
	},

   When we hover on this.displayTodos(), click the down arrow, then it will bring us to the displayTodos() function.

ðŸ”… With debugger we can see the process on how our code runs step by step.

ðŸ”… Debugger is the most important tools because it helps solving problem faster. We can easily spot 
	 the issues with it. It also helps to understand our code, even though when it works.
